# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

![Computers](http://media2.giphy.com/media/HjvvlK5jJRGq4/original.gif)

* A computer (ideally osx/\*nix)
* A text editor you are comfortable with. Use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) if you aren't sure what to use.
* Somewhere to write answers/take notes/write down thoughts or questions. Ideally somewhere you can refer back to easily. I would suggest a notebook if your handwriting is okay. Otherwise a google doc or text file checked into github somewhere so you don't lose it.

That's about it. Everything else we can figure out as we go along.
