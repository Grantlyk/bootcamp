# Hello!

![Howdy](http://media.giphy.com/media/fm5JqspHFgIXm/original.gif)

Welcome to the Float bootcamp. The hope for this bootcamp is to get you up to speed with the basics of what you need to know to work on Float, and be a reasonably good web developer.

You won't know everything you need to know at the end of this program. You probably won't even know most of what you need to know. But my hope is that I can compress the majority of what I have learned over the last 3 years as the CTO of Float into something you can assimilate in a few weeks so you at least have a better starting point than I did a few years ago.

## Caveats

You are the first people to have done this course. Indeed, most of this course isn't written yet, but will be written as you need it. For this reason I can't guarantee it will be perfect (it won't) but I will do my best. Given that, please raise any issues about how this is going with me as you come to them. If something is genuinely too easy, please say so. Or if you are struggling with something which I though might take a day, but it looks like it will take a week, just shout and we can rearrange.

I am (mostly) a very nice person, and the only outcome I want from this course is for you to learn as much as _you_ can in as short a time as possible. So if it's not satisfying that goal, just shout.


## What should you expect from me (Phil)

* To treat you with respect and patience at all times.
* To answer your questions as truthfully as I can, based on my knowledge and experience to date.
* To assess your progress as honestly, but fairly and kindly as I can.
* That sometimes I may be too busy at a given moment to help you immediately (sometimes I will have work I _need_ to do) but that I will help as soon as I can.
* That sometimes I will be wrong.

If I am failing at any of these, or something else you think is important, please raise your concerns with me, or with Colin so that we can address them as quickly as possible :)


## What I expect from you

* That you will treat me with respect and patience.
* That you treat each other with respect and patience
* That you are willing to learn and try your best.
* That you focus on learning as much as possible from each exercise rather than just completing it as fast as possible - this is about learning, not finishing.
* That you speak up when you have issues or are struggling.
* To understand that sometimes this will be hard, and not to get too frustrated - I will _never_ judge you for struggling with something.
* That you will try to solve things on your own, or with each other, before asking me for help - struggling through things is part of the learning process and I won't always be around/or able to answer your questions. Of course, if you _are_ stuck, or think I can explain something better than you understand, do ask.
* To commit the time and effort that you have to this course, but no more. Even if you have a crappy day one day and don't get very far, I will not expect you to stay up late or work at the weekend to catch up. Learning to manage your time and energy is an important part of being a software developer.

## Rough Outline

These are roughly the things I hope you will learn:

* Enough git to get by.
* Some Ruby.
* The basics of the Rails ruby web framework.
* Some JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
* The what, why and how of building single-page applications in Java/CoffeeScript, using Backbone.js.
* The basics of heroku as a deployment platform for Rails.
* The what, why and how of grunt.
* The rough architecture of Float as a web application.
* Just enough accounting so that you can understand how float works.
* What an API is.
* The basics of integrating with third party (freeagent/xero/etc) apis.
* How (technically) Float builds and forecasts cash flow for a business.
* How to develop, test, and deploy the Float app.
* What to look out for to be a productive, happy, software developer.
* Some thoughts as to how we will work in a team successfully.
